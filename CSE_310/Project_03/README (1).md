# Overview

This project is my first attempt working in django and it serves as a guide for my future django projects. This project allowed me to work more with html and css. I have enjoyed working with them before and I am glad I got the opprtunity to work on another project again. 

My web app serves as a personal portfolio/website. It also has a post section where I can leave a post on upadates on my life. To run my test server I used the following command: python manage.py runserver. I have to be the right directroy in order to accomplish this task. I used localhost:8000 to open up to see the first page of the app. 

# Purpose of this Software

The purpose of this software is for me to put my professional experience on a website. I also had the opportunity to use a new technology to accomplish this.

# Web Pages

My first two pages serve as an online version of my resume and my story. The first webpage talks about where I grew up and how I ended up here as well as what my future goals are. The second webpage talks about my professional work and skills. It includes my work and school experience.The third webpage renders the post from the database. Each page has a comment form that redirects you to the post page. In the navbar there are links to each webpage. You can also be redirected to the posts page after making a comment. Each page has a dynamically created form while the post page also has a dynamically created div contaning one of the comments in the database for each comment.

# Development Environment

I used django python 3.9.7 and I also created the webpages in html and their styles in css. My database is stored in an sqlite3 file. I also used the python datetime library and built in django libraries as well.
